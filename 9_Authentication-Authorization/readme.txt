Authentication:- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It involves verifying the user's identity by checking their username and password. If the credentials are correct, the user is granted access to the system.
Authorization:- Authorization is the process of granting access to a user based on their role or permissions. It involves verifying the user's role or permissions and granting access to the system accordingly. For example, a user with a role of "admin" can access all the features of the system, while a user with a role of "user" can only access a specific feature.

Cookie:- A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on the user's computer by the website that the user visits. Cookies are used to store information about the user's session, such as their login status, preferences, and other data. Cookies are sent to the user's computer by the website and are then stored on the user's computer. The website can then access the data in the cookie to identify the user and provide a personalized experience.
Bcrypt:- Bcrypt is a password hashing algorithm that is designed to be slow and resistant to brute-force attacks. It is commonly used in web applications to store user passwords securely. Bcrypt is a popular choice for password hashing because it is secure, easy to use, and computationally efficient.
JWT:- JWT is a JSON Web Token that is used to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are signed with a secret key, which means that the data in the JWT can be verified and trusted. JWTs are commonly used in web applications to authenticate users and authorize access to resources.
